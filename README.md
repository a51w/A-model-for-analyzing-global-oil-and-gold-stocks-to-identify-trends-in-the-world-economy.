# A-model-for-analyzing-global-oil-and-gold-stocks-to-identify-trends-in-the-world-economy.

In today’s market, investments in assets such as oil and gold stocks are gaining attention from investors, as they are highly sensitive to both domestic and international economic factors. This study focuses on time series analysis of oil and gold stock prices in Thailand. Specifically, it analyzes:

Oil Stock: PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), a leading oil exploration and production company in Thailand.

Gold Stock: KTAM Gold ETF Tracker (GLD.BK), which tracks the global gold price.

Both assets are closely linked to external factors such as global crude oil prices, international gold prices, USD/THB exchange rates, and overall macroeconomic conditions.

The dataset covers weekly data from September 1, 2011 to April 1, 2025 (14 years), enabling detailed analysis of long-term trends and relationships. In addition, financial indicators (EPS, ROE, Net Profit Margin), the U.S. Federal Funds Rate, and special events such as the COVID-19 pandemic are considered to capture their effects on market volatility. This study aims not only to understand asset price behavior but also to provide useful insights for investors making decisions in a changing market environment.

Research Focus

The analysis investigates the relationship between economic factors and stock prices in the Thai Stock Exchange, focusing on oil stocks and gold stocks.

1. Oil Stock Data (PTTEP)

The target variable is the stock price of PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP). Since its business is directly tied to the global oil market, PTTEP’s price is sensitive to energy-related factors.

Key explanatory variables include:

Global crude oil prices – represented by the average of three benchmarks: Brent Crude Oil (BZ=F), Crude Oil (CL=F), and W&T Offshore (WTI).

USD/THB exchange rate – since PTTEP earns revenue in USD, currency fluctuations affect net profit.

Other oil-related stock indices – e.g., PTT stock prices, used to analyze correlations and create an Oil Stock Index.

Financial indicators – Earnings Per Share (EPS), Return on Equity (ROE), and Net Profit Margin.

2. Gold Stock Data (GLD.BK)

The target variable is the price of KTAM Gold ETF Tracker (GLD.BK).

Key explanatory variables include:

Global gold spot price – represented by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD).

USD/THB exchange rate – as gold is traded globally in USD.

U.S. Federal Funds Rate – influencing global demand for gold.

Economic risk events – with COVID-19 used as a case study of global shock.

Domestic Thai gold prices – based on the selling price of gold bars published by the Gold Traders Association of Thailand.

Methodology

The study applies both correlation analysis and statistical modeling to evaluate the influence of each factor on the target stock prices. This helps determine the direction and strength of relationships, providing insight into potential future trends of oil and gold stocks in Thailand.
